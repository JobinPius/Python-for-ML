 # Feedback Analysis for Intel course

## Introduction

This feedback report presents an analysis of student satisfaction with regards to teacher's teaching quality, knowledge, and other relevant aspects. The feedback was collected through a survey administered to students, asking them to evaluate various aspects of their teachers' performance and their overall learning experience.

## Importing necessary libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## Loading Data

```python
#pip install seaborn
#df_class=pd.read_csv("/content/survey_data.csv")
df_class=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijuswamy/Intel-Unnati-sessions/main/Feed_back_data.csv")
df_class.head()
```

## Data wrangling

```python
df_class.info()
df_class = df_class.drop(['Timestamp','Email ID','Please provide any additional comments, suggestions, or feedback you have regarding the session. Your insights are valuable and will help us enhance the overall learning experience.'],axis=1)
df_class.info()
df_class.columns = ["Name","Branch","Semester","Resourse Person","Content Quality","Effeciveness","Expertise","Relevance","Overall Organization"]
df_class.sample(5)
# checking for null
df_class.isnull().sum().sum()
# dimension
df_class.shape
```


## Dataset overview
The dataset contains feedback responses from participants of a session. It includes several columns:

  * Timestamp: It includes the date and time when the feedback was submitted by the student.

  * Name of the Participant: The name of the participant who provided the feedback.

  * Email ID: The email address of the participant.

  * Branch: from which branch the student comes from.

  * Semester: The current semester of the participant.

  * Resource Person of the session: The resource person for the session.

  * Ratings: It is the rating provided by the participant for the teachers who conducted the session based on several factors like content quality,effectiveness 
             etc


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   ```python
## creating a percentage analysis of RP-wise distribution of data
round(df_class["Resourse Person"].value_counts(normalize=True)*100,2)
## creating a percentage analysis of RP-wise distribution of data
round(df_class["Name"].value_counts(normalize=True)*100,2)
```

* Resource Person-wise Distribution: This report provides an analysis of the feedback collected from students regarding their satisfaction with resource persons 
   
* Participant Name Analysis:This report provides an analysis of participant names in the context of an educational program or event.

* Visualization: created to understand the faculty-wise distribution of data  across different categories
 
  ```python
  ```python
  ax = plt.subplot(1,2,1)
  ax = sns.countplot(x='Resourse Person', data=df_class)
  #ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0])
  plt.title("Faculty-wise distribution of data", fontsize=20,color = 'Brown',pad=20)
  ax =plt.subplot(1,2,2)
  ax=df_class['Resourse Person'].value_counts().plot.pie(explode=[0.1, 0.1,0.1,0.1],autopct='%1.2f%%',shadow=True);
  ax.set_title(label = "Resourse Person", fontsize = 20,color='Brown',pad=20);
  ```
  ```python
  ax = plt.subplot(1,2,1)
  ax = sns.countplot(x='Resourse Person', data=df_class)
  #ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0])
  plt.title("Faculty-wise distribution of data", fontsize=20,color = 'Brown',pad=20)
  ax =plt.subplot(1,2,2)
  ax=df_class['Resourse Person'].value_counts().plot.pie(explode=[0.1, 0.1,0.1,0.1],autopct='%1.2f%%',shadow=True);
  ax.set_title(label = "Resourse Person", fontsize = 20,color='Brown',pad=20);
  ```

## Content Quality:

 * This boxplot suggests that the majority of resource persons are consistently delivering high-quality content, as reflected by the median ratings.

 * the absence of outliers and the narrow interquartile range across all participants indicate a consistent trend of high ratings, underscoring the uniformity of 
   positive feedback.

  ```python
  sns.boxplot(y=df_class['Resourse Person'],x=df_class['Content Quality'])
  plt.show()  
  ```

## Effectiveness:

 * The effectiveness of the sessions seems to be rated highly as well, with few outliers indicating occasional deviations from otherwise high ratings.
 * Mrs. Veena A Kumar and Mrs. Gayathri J L have outliers on the lower end, which might suggest specific sessions where the effectiveness was rated lower than 
   usual.

  ```python
  sns.boxplot(y=df_class['Resourse Person'],x=df_class['Effectiveness'])
  plt.show()
  ```

## Expertise:

 * Similar to effectiveness, expertise ratings are high with few outliers.

 * The outliers for Mrs. Veena A Kumar and Mrs. Gayathri J L suggest that there were certain sessions where the perceived expertise of the resource person 
   was not up to the participants' expectations.

   
  ```python
  sns.boxplot(y=df_class['Resourse Person'],x=df_class['Expertise'])
  plt.show()
  ```

## Relevance: 

 * Relevance suggests that the  session content was well-aligned with the participants' needs and was perceived as highly relevant to real-world scenarios, as 
   reflected by the absence of outliers and consistently high median values.
 
 
  ```python
  sns.boxplot(y=df_class['Resourse Person'],x=df_class['Relevance'])
  plt.show()
  ```

## Ratings by Branch

This uniformity in tight interquartile ranges across all branches in content quality ratings, with only a few outliers, indicates a consistent perception of high content quality irrespective of the academic department.

 ```python
  sns.boxplot(y=df_class['Resourse Person'],x=df_class['Branch'])
  plt.show()
  ```

# Using K-means Clustering to identify segmentation over student's satisfaction

## For finding the best value of k using elbow method

```python
input_col=["Content Quality","Effeciveness","Expertise","Relevance","Overall Organization"]
X=df_class[input_col].values
# Initialize an empty list to store the within-cluster sum of squares
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
wcss = []

# Try different values of k
for k in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k,n_init='auto', random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)# here inertia calculate sum of square distance in each cluster
# Plot the within-cluster sum of squares for different values of k
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker='o')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')
plt.ylabel('Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)')
plt.title('Elbow Method')
plt.show()

```

## Using Gridsearch method

```python
# Define the parameter grid
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'n_clusters': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}

# Create a KMeans object
kmeans = KMeans(n_init='auto',random_state=42)

# Create a GridSearchCV object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(kmeans, param_grid, cv=5)

# Perform grid search
grid_search.fit(X)

# Get the best parameters and the best score
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_score = grid_search.best_score_
print("Best Parameters:", best_params)
print("Best Score:", best_score)
```

## Implementing K-means clustering

```python
# Perform k-means clustering
k = 3 # Number of clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k,n_init='auto', random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)
```

##### KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_init='auto', random_state=42)
##### In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.
##### On GitHub, the HTML representation is unable to render, please try loading this page with nbviewer.org.


## Extracting labels and cluster centers

```python
# Get the cluster labels and centroids
labels = kmeans.labels_
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

# Add the cluster labels to the DataFrame
df_class['Cluster'] = labels
df_class.head()
```

## Visualizing the clustering using first two features

```python
# Visualize the clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 1], X[:, 2], c=labels, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(centroids[:,1], centroids[:, 2], marker='X', s=200, c='red')
plt.xlabel(input_col[1])
plt.ylabel(input_col[2])
plt.title('K-means Clustering')
plt.show()
```
